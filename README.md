## Description

Welcome to the debriefing of Operation Portfolio Page, a covert mission aimed at creating a comprehensive portfolio page that showcases the skills, talents, and previous work of a potential recruit. This mission was executed with the objective of providing employers with a clear and concise view of the recruit's capabilities, thereby aiding in their decision-making process.

Upon loading the portfolio, you will be presented with the recruit's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. This is designed to provide a quick overview of the recruit's identity and capabilities.

The portfolio is equipped with a user-friendly navigation system. Clicking on any of the links in the navigation will smoothly scroll the UI to the corresponding section, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The 'Work' section of the portfolio is designed to showcase the recruit's previous missions. Clicking on the link to this section will scroll the UI to a section with titled images of the recruit's applications. The first application presented is of significant importance and is therefore displayed larger than the others.

Each application image serves as a portal to the deployed application. Clicking on these images will transport you directly to the live application, allowing you to experience the recruit's work firsthand.

The portfolio page is designed to be responsive and adaptable. Whether you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you will be presented with a layout that adapts to your viewport, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experience.

This concludes the debriefing of Operation Portfolio Page. The mission was a success, resulting in a comprehensive and user-friendly portfolio page that effectively showcases the recruit's skills and previous work.

## Usage

This is a covert operation where you will be assessing the potential of a candidate for a position in your team. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves navigating through a portfolio page built by the candidate.

Upon loading the portfolio, you will be presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. This is your first point of contact with the candidate, use it wisely.

When you click one of the links in the navigation, the UI will scroll to the corresponding section. This is designed to give you a seamless experience while navigating through the portfolio.

Clicking on the link to the section about their work will scroll the UI to a section with titled images of the developer's applications. This is where you get to see the fruits of their labor. Pay close attention to the details.

The developer's first application will be presented in a larger image size than the others. This is likely their proudest achievement, so take a good look.

Clicking on the images of the applications will take you to that deployed application. This is your chance to see their work in action. Test it, play with it, and see if it meets your standards.

Finally, when you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, you will be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport. This is a test of their adaptability and attention to detail. A good developer knows that their work will be viewed on various devices and plans accordingly.

Remember, this is a covert operation. Your mission is to assess the potential of the candidate without them knowing. Good luck.
